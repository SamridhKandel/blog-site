In this world of constant entropy, the highs and lows there's one thing that remains constant for us Nepali ; A solid cup of tea. The power a cup of tea holds that helps us find solace even in the direst of moments is something that is unexplainable. The world might be ending but you still see the light at the end of the tunnel with a cup of tea in your hands.  

Even if you flunked your tests or got your heartbroken a simple **"oi chiya khana jam"** from your friend is all that's needed to lighten up your mood and make you open up. The thing about tea is that it also pairs well with everything have it with biscuits, pastry or even a cigarrete you can't go wrong. 


As promised i wanted to review the places I have went to eat in this blog. So here are the places along with my personal ratings.

- **Chiya wala**  
  [Located at maitighar/thapathali](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chiyawala+since+1956/@27.6907413,85.3198558,19z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x39eb1918d2775257:0x13bd6ea37f73da86!8m2!3d27.6906262!4d85.3207075!16s%2Fg%2F11h27mqjcq?entry=ttu) this is the place that hands down serves the best tea I have ever had. The place is perfect for enjoying the sun and a cup of tea with your friends on a cold day. The price might be on the higher end but it is very worth it. Their classic "ghanshyam chiya" has been the same since 1956 when they first opened.  
    - Price: $$
    - Taste: ★★★★☆
    - Ambience: ★★★★☆

- **Random place in Swayambhu**  
    This place is right above the bike parking area in Swayambhu. We stumbled upon here our midterms in 1st semester now we go there after every mid terms. Sadly the taste of the chiya has degraded quite a lot but it is still a very chill and scenic place to hangout with your friends.  
    - Price: $
    - Taste: ★★★☆☆
    - Ambience: ★★★★☆

- **Mama ko chiya pasal**  
    [Located at the heart of the city Basantapur](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mama's+Tea+Shop/@27.7034402,85.3072371,21z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x39eb1918d2775257:0x13bd6ea37f73da86!2sChiyawala+since+1956!8m2!3d27.6906262!4d85.3207075!16s%2Fg%2F11h27mqjcq!3m5!1s0x39eb18566b70444f:0x12438ddf602f4727!8m2!3d27.7033455!4d85.307433!16s%2Fg%2F11b6hykylr?entry=ttu) the tea here is very homelike. The price is also not too expensive and you can enjoy the hustle and bustle of Kathmandu durbar square alongside your tea. A pairing of the donuts they sell with the tea is what i recommend.  
    - Price: $
    - Taste: ★★★☆☆
    - Ambience: ★★★☆☆

I will try and update this blog with more spots & images when I can and visit more places worth mentioning. 

PS: I figured writing is very hard and I'm very bad at it.
